    <h3>
        The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, 
        its portability, security, and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one of the main 
        factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust type system and allows automatic memory management. 
        It is a powerful language for creating complex programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features. 
        In addition, Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use. 
        Java is being used by more than 9 million developers around the world. 
        It continues to be a widely used language in the software development industry thanks to its popularity and adaptability, 
        which have made it a favourite among entrepreneurs and developers alike.
        Java includes a huge selection of libraries and frameworks that make it simpler for programmers to create sophisticated applications. 
        There are many useful classes and functions in Java’s standard library, and additional libraries and frameworks streamline the development 
        process while adding even more capability.

   <p id="one">Features of Java</p>
   <pre id="two">A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below:</pre>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Platform independence:</span> Java is a “write once, run anywhere” language, meaning that Java code can run without any changes on any platform that supports Java.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Object-oriented language:</span> Java is an object-oriented language that enables programmers to create modular, reusable code components known as objects, making it simpler to develop and maintain complex programmes.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Automatic memory management:</span>  Java includes an automatic memory management mechanism that relieves developers of the need to manually handle memory allocation and deallocation.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Security:</span>Java contains built-in security measures that can block unauthorised access and shield users from potential security risks. Java was created with security in mind.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Rich API:</span> The Java standard library has a sizable number of classes and methods, giving programmers a wide range of practical tools for creating applications.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Multi-threading support:</span> Support for multithreading is integrated into Java, enabling programmers to create concurrent applications that can handle running several threads at once.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">High performance: </span> Java is renowned for having a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which optimises code execution while it is running.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Scalability:</span>  Java’s modular architecture and object-oriented programming make it simpler to create large-scale programmes that can be scaled up or down based on demand.</p>
   <p id="three">&#9642;<span class="p1">Simplified syntax:</span>  Java has a syntax that is simpler than other programming languages, making it simpler for developers to write and read code.</p><br>
   <p id="four">Because they enable writing, testing, and deploying software applications simpler, quicker, and more effectively, Java’s characteristics are crucial for software development. These capabilities enable developers to produce strong, safe, and high-performing programmes that satisfy the requirements of contemporary software development.</p><br>
